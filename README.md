# Tetris Game

A simple Tetris game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Introduction

This Tetris game allows players to enjoy the classic gameplay of Tetris right on their computer. Players can control the falling Tetriminos (Tetris blocks) using arrow keys and rotate them to fit into the gaps. The goal is to complete horizontal lines with no gaps, which will then clear from the board and earn points. The game continues until the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the playfield, resulting in a game over.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay experience.
- Random generation of Tetriminos with different shapes and colors.
- Score tracking and level progression.
- Responsive controls for moving and rotating Tetriminos.
- Game over detection when the playfield is filled to the top.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Use the **arrow keys** to move Tetriminos left, right, or down.
   - Press the **up arrow key** to rotate Tetriminos.
   - Press the **spacebar** to instantly drop Tetriminos to the bottom.
   - Press the **ESC key** to restart the game.

2. **Objective**:
   - Arrange falling Tetriminos to form complete horizontal lines.
   - Cleared lines will earn points, and the game level will increase as the score progresses.
   - The game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the playfield.
